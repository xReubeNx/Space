This web application is a portfolio website where I experiment with different technologies, along with improving plain css and javascript.
This site contains a Home page, a Picture of the Day page, Solar System page and a Search page.

It uses NASA API's to fetch information, both for the picture of the day and for searching the nasa image and video library.
